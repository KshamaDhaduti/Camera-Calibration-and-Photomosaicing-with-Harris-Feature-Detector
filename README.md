This project focuses on the role and use of calibrated cameras for photomosaicing. The implementation involves using a camera phone and MATLAB to perform camera calibration, capture overlapping images, and create panoramic mosaics. The outcomes of the project include understanding camera calibration, feature detection using the Harris corner detector, and generating high-quality panoramic images. The project aims to provide practical experience in image stitching techniques and showcase the effectiveness of calibrated cameras in robotics and computer vision applications.
